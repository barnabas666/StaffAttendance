This solution is a staff management and attendance system built with .NET 8.0, designed for flexibility and multi-database support. It consists of:

•	StaffAtt.Web: An ASP.NET Core MVC web application for staff registration, profile management, and administration. It uses:
•	An Identity database (SQLite, configured in StaffAtt.Web/appsettings.json) for authentication and user management.
•	A downloadable desktop application available at StaffAtt.Web/wwwroot/downloads/DesktopApp.zip.
•	StaffAtt.Desktop: A WPF desktop application for recording staff check-ins and check-outs. It is distributed as a portable app for end users to run locally.
•	StaffAttLibrary: A shared .NET 8.0 class library containing all business logic and data access.
•	Both the web and desktop applications interact exclusively with this library, which abstracts all database operations.
•	The library supports three types of main StaffAtt databases:
•	SQL Server (using stored procedures, with scripts and schema in the StaffAttDB/ folder)
•	SQLite (using raw SQL queries stored in StaffAttLibrary/SqliteQueries/)
•	PostgreSQL (using raw SQL queries stored in StaffAttLibrary/PostgreSQL/, planned as the main type for deployment)
•	The main StaffAtt database (regardless of backend) is shared by both the web and desktop applications via the library.
•	Database Diagram: The structure of the main StaffAtt database is documented in StaffAttDbDiagram.png at the solution root.
•	Unit Tests: The solution includes automated tests to verify business logic and data operations.

Summary:
The system enables staff registration, profile updates, and attendance tracking, with administrative features for managing staff and access rights. Both the web and desktop apps interact with the main StaffAtt database only through the shared library, ensuring a consistent and flexible data layer. The solution is designed for easy deployment to Azure and supports switching between SQL Server, SQLite, and PostgreSQL as the main database backend. Key file locations and database options are clearly organized for maintainability and cloud deployment.
