    <h3>Welcome to the web application - Staff Attendance.</h3>

    <p>
        First, perform a basic registration in the system - enter your email and password on the
        <a asp-area="Identity" asp-page="/Account/Register">Register</a> page. Then confirm the
        registration email. Later, you can request a reset of your password if you forget it.
    </p>

    <p>
        After <a asp-area="Identity" asp-page="/Account/Login">login</a> into the system using your email
        and password, you will find yourself in the web application - Staff Attendance. Here you must fill
        in your contact details + PIN. Then you will be redirected to the main part of the web application,
        where you can check your details(name, surname, alias, etc.) or change them. There is also an overview
        of all your check-ins/check-outs.
    </p>
    <p>
        The PIN is a 4-digit number that you will use to log in to the desktop application, where you will
        record your check-ins/check-outs. You can change the PIN at any time in the web application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your alias will be automatically generated from your name and surname, which, together with the PIN,
        is used to enter the desktop application, in which you will record your check-ins/check-outs.
        Access to the desktop application will be granted to you by the web application admin. If you change
        your contact details, you will again have to be granted permission by the admin to enter the
        desktop check-ins/check-outs application.
    </p>

    <p>
        The website administrator has access to all employee data. He can see their complete personal details
        and check-ins/check-outs records. He has rights to edit employees, can change the department they
        belong to and most importantly grants rights to access the desktop check-in/check-out application. He
        can also completely delete employee records.
